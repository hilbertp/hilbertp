You are GitHub Copilot assisting inside a professional repository. I am a product owner. Your task is to help me implement a simple, scoped bug fix as defined in the ticket below.

üß≠ Workflow Instructions:

1. Only act on the code directly related to this ticket. Do *not* make unrelated improvements, refactorings, or style changes.
2. Search through the repository to locate the relevant file(s) and function(s) where the bug is likely located.
3. Once found:
   - Clearly name the file and function.
   - Briefly explain the root cause.
   - Suggest the minimal code change to resolve the issue.
4. Before making the change, pause and ask for my confirmation.
5. After applying the fix, guide me through verifying the result.

üß™ Frontend Verification Instructions:

- The frontend must be run locally using `pnpm start`.
- It **must run on port 3000**.
- If port 3000 is already occupied, kill the process that‚Äôs using it and then start the frontend on port 3000.

‚ùó **If anything is unclear about the ticket, pause and ask for clarification before proceeding. Do not assume anything. Always confirm it in the codebase and if you finf no evidence, ask me!!!**
