# 05-Success Story: First AI-Development in KIBB

By combining the roles of product owner, frontend developer, backend developer, architect, UI/UX engineer, and quality assurance engineer, and collaborating closely with peer reviewer Tobias and QA engineer Onur, we delivered a robust feature from user story to production, combining all six key roles in one AI-assisted person.
The process—clarifying requirements, implementing with tests, documenting for peer review, and validating with regression tests—has now been internalized, enabling us to accelerate future development cycles with confidence and quality.

## FR01-Links_to_Manual: End-to-End Delivery and Documentation

- Successfully delivered the manual documentation link feature with improved UI/UX, consistent validation logic, and robust error handling.
- All code, tests, and documentation were aligned, and the CI/CD pipeline passed without issues.
- The detailed, chronologically structured Erfahrungsbericht was created and cross-referenced in all related documentation files, providing full traceability and serving as a model for future features.
- Manual and end-to-end tests (including the scenario for supplying only a path) were documented and validated.
- This process demonstrated the value of a documentation-first approach and comprehensive peer review, accelerating onboarding and reducing future risk.
