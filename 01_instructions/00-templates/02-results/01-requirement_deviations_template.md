# Requirement Deviations Template

This document records where development deviated from requirements or user story suggestions. For each deviation, specify:
- **Area/Feature Name**
- **Deviation** (what was done differently)
- **Reasoning** (why the deviation was made)
- **Impact** (what effect this had)

---

## [Area/Feature Name]

- **Deviation:**  
  <Describe what was done differently from the requirement or user story>
- **Reasoning:**  
  <Explain why this deviation was made (e.g., usability, technical constraints, simplification)>
- **Impact:**  
  <Describe the impact of this deviation (e.g., improved UX, reduced complexity, no functional change, etc.)>

---

> Add more sections as needed for each deviation. Use this template to ensure all requirement changes are documented and justified.
