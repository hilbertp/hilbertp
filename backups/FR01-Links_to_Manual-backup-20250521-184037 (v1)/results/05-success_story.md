# 05-Success Story: First AI-Development in KIBB

By combining the roles of product owner, backend engineer, frontend engineer, and architect, and collaborating closely with peer reviewer Tobias and QA engineer Onur, we delivered a robust feature from user story to production, combining several key roles in one AI-assisted person.
The process—clarifying requirements, implementing with tests, documenting for peer review, and validating with regression tests—has now been internalized, enabling us to accelerate future development cycles with confidence and quality.
